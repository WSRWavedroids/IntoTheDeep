/**
 * This is an example auto that showcases movement and control of two servos autonomously.
 * It is a 0+4 (Specimen + Sample) bucket auto. It scores a neutral preload and then pickups 3 samples from the ground and scores them before parking.
 * There are examples of different ways to build paths.
 * A path progression method has been created and can advance based on time, position, or other factors.

     * Poses are built with three constructors: x, y, and heading (in Radians).
     * Pedro uses 0 - 144 for x and y, with 0, 0 being on the bottom left.
     * (For Into the Deep, this would be Blue Observation Zone (0,0) to Red Observation Zone (144,144).)
     * Even though Pedro uses a different coordinate system than RR, you can convert any roadrunner pose by adding +72 both the x and y.
     * This visualizer is very easy to use to find and create paths/pathchains/poses: <https://pedro-path-generator.vercel.app/>
     * Lets assume our robot is 18 by 18 inches
     * Lets assume the Robot is facing the human player and we want to score in the bucket */
